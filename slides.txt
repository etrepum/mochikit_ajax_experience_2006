What's MochiKit?
================

.. class:: incremental

* Makes JavaScript suck less
* Provides browser workarounds
* Simplifies AJAX and DOM
* Plays nicely with other code


Another library?!
=================

.. class:: incremental

* Prototype was undocumented, no tests, didn't play nice
* Dojo had no documentation or demos
* Everything else was outdated, not liberally licensed,
  not cross-platform


Why MochiKit?
=============

.. class:: incremental

* Python-like (think "standard library")
* Abstracts async behavior
* MochiKit.DOM syntax makes DOM painless
* MochiKit.Signal works around LOTS of browser misfeatures (keyboard events!)
* Extremely well documented, tested, stable
* Safari 2, Firefox 1, IE 6, Opera 8


Why not MochiKit?
=================

.. class:: incremental

* No support for IE 5.5
* No widgets
* No animation, transitions, etc.
* ... but we're working on a Scriptaculous port (MochiKit 1.4)
